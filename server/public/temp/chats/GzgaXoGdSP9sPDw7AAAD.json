[{"role":"user","content":"hi sir"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Hi Jeyachandran! Thanks for coming in today. Can you start by telling me a little bit about your background and how you got interested in AI and development?"},{"role":"user","content":"\n Sir, I am interested in AI development because I am learning and deep learning is very high level."},{"role":"assistant","content":"So, you're interested in AI development because you're drawn to the complexities and possibilities offered by deep learning. That's a great starting point.\n\nCan you tell me more about what excites you about AI development? Is there a particular project or application that you've worked on recently that you're passionate about?"},{"role":"user","content":" yes sir, I created many applications for AE development I created a new planning project for AE Quest Generator it is an input for YouTube video or PDF or document it will be converted to Google Form directly it contains the input number of postings and a level of the question like a medium hard and easy and this is the PDF has the under page it will be converted to 10 questions and output is be Google form and I attached the tap switches and the monitoring systems."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Wow, that sounds like an impressive project! Creating an AI-powered quest generator that can convert PDFs or YouTube videos into Google Forms is a great example of applying AI to a real-world problem.\n\nI'm curious to know more about how you implemented this project. For example, what algorithms or techniques did you use to convert the PDF or video content into the quiz format? And can you walk me through the process of how the quest generator generates the questions and identifies their level of difficulty?"},{"role":"user","content":" Yes sir, I have more effort on this project and I use my LLM using my NLP using I create LLM and I trained more amount of data and I preprocessing the data and finally I create one model and integrate my trend and application."},{"role":"assistant","content":"So you used your knowledge of LLM (Large Language Model) and NLP (Natural Language Processing) to train a model that can preprocess and convert the input PDF or video content into a quiz format. That's a great application of AI and NLP concepts.\n\nCan you tell me more about the preprocessing steps you took? For example, how did you handle issues like entity recognition, part-of-speech tagging, and sentiment analysis to prepare the data for training the model?"}]

Before we dive into the interview, I'd like to review your resume and get a better understanding of your background and experience. Can you tell me a little bit about your background in developing e-commerce websites using React.js, Node.js, and React Native at Fabromant? How did you find working on those projects, and what did you learn from those experiences?"}]

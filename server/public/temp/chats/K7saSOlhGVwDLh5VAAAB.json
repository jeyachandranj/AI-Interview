[{"role":"user","content":"hi sir"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Hi there! Welcome to the technical round of the interview. I'm Jeyachandran, the hiring officer, and I'll be conducting this interview. Before we begin, I'd like to go over your resume and ask some questions based on your skills and experience. Can you walk me through your experience as a React Developer at SKEWESS TECH? What were some of the key responsibilities and achievements in that role?"},{"role":"user","content":"\n Yes sir, I have completed many projects in full stock development."},{"role":"assistant","content":"That's great to hear! Can you elaborate on one specific project you worked on as a full-stack developer? For instance, you mentioned the Virtual AI Interview project, could you tell me more about that? What were the primary technologies used, and what were some of the key features you implemented in that project?"},{"role":"user","content":" Yes sir, the virtual interview process is I developed frontend react and backend node.js and integrated db is MongoDB and I used Lama3 AI and developer prompting and I will use the 3.js is Robo and evolve it answer also AI."},{"role":"assistant","content":"That sounds like an impressive project. So, you developed the frontend using React, the backend using Node.js, and integrated it with a MongoDB database. You also used Llama3 AI for natural language processing and developer prompting, and even integrated RoBo.js to evolve the answers using AI. \n\nCan you tell me more about how you implemented the AI-powered features in this project? For instance, how did you integrate the Llama3 AI with your React and Node.js code?"},{"role":"user","content":" I integrate Lama3 for the GROC model. I used the GROC and applied the GROC model. I integrate Node.js API and the prompt will be sent to the API to Node and the prompt will be sent to the Lama AI and return the response also sent to the React. and I will the test will be convert to the speech using as well IP key and display the output"},{"role":"assistant","content":"So, you integrated Llama3 AI's GROC model with your Node.js API, which received the prompts and sent them to the Llama3 AI for processing. The output was then sent back to your React frontend, where it was displayed to the user.\n\nAnd you also mentioned that you used a text-to-speech conversion using an IP key to convert the test results to speech output. That's a great feature to have, especially in a virtual interview setting where users may prefer a more auditory experience.\n\nCan you tell me more about how you secured the communication between the React client and the Node.js API, particularly when sending prompts and receiving responses from the Llama3 AI?"},{"role":"user","content":" Yes sir, in frontend I passed the data in API and I used the WebCycate in backend because the don't refresh and I used the WebCycate and the API will be sent to the backend and the same process the output will be sent to the client."},{"role":"assistant","content":"So, you used WebCate to handle the communication between the frontend and the backend, ensuring that the data is sent securely and without refreshing the page. That's a great way to maintain a smooth user experience and prevent disruptions.\n\nCan you tell me more about how you implemented the data encryption and decryption in this project? Were you using any specific encryption algorithms or libraries to protect the data in transit and at rest?"},{"role":"user","content":" I said in data encryption decrypt and store the password I use the data encrypt library and store the string format to store the password and database and again I retrieved decrypt and I retrieved a password"},{"role":"assistant","content":"So, you used the Data Encrypt library to encrypt the password, and then stored it in a string format in the database. Later, when you needed to retrieve the password, you used the same library to decrypt it.\n\nCan you tell me more about the specific encryption algorithm used by the Data Encrypt library, or if it was a custom implementation? Also, did you perform any key management or password hashing to further secure the stored passwords?"}]

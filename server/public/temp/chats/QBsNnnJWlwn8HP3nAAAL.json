[{"role":"user","content":"hi sir"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Hello Jeyachandran! Nice to meet you. I'm Jeyachandran, the hiring officer. I've reviewed your resume and I have to say, it's impressive. You've had a wide range of experiences in AI project development, data engineering, and web and app development. Let's dive into your technical skills. Can you tell me about your experience with machine learning and deep learning?"},{"role":"user","content":"3 years sir"},{"role":"assistant","content":"You've had experience with machine learning and deep learning for the past 3 years. That's a significant amount of time. Can you walk me through a project where you applied machine learning or deep learning to solve a real-world problem? For example, was it a chatbot, image recognition, or something else?"},{"role":"user","content":"\nimage regonation"},{"role":"assistant","content":"You've worked on an image recognition project using machine learning or deep learning. That's quite interesting. Can you tell me more about the project? What was the goal of the project, and what specific techniques did you use to achieve it? For example, was it object detection, image classification, or something else?"},{"role":"user","content":"I worked on cancer classification using colposcopy images"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Wow, that sounds like a very impactful project! Cancer classification is a crucial task, and using colposcopy images is a unique challenge. Can you tell me more about the project? What specific machine learning or deep learning methods did you use to classify the images, and what were some of the key findings or results from the project?"},{"role":"user","content":"\nI used CNN and YoLO to detect cancerous lesionns in colposcopy images that are stained in acetic acid"},{"role":"assistant","content":"So you used Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and You Only Look Once (YoLO) to detect cancerous lesions in colposcopy images that are stained with acetic acid. That's a very specific application of deep learning. Can you tell me more about the architecture and hyperparameters you used for the CNN, and how you fine-tuned it for this specific task?"}]

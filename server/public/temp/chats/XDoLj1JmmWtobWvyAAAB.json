[{"role":"user","content":"hi sir"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Hello Jeyachandran! Nice to meet you. I'm Jeyachandran, the hiring officer. We're here to conduct a technical round of your job interview. I'll be reviewing your resume and asking you some technical questions related to your skills and experience. Let's get started! Can you walk me through your React Development experience, specifically the online signing system you developed as an intern at SKEWESS TECH? What was the core problem you were trying to solve, and how did you approach it?"},{"role":"user","content":"\n Sir, I can be there many projects in full stock."},{"role":"assistant","content":"So, you're excited about your project experiences! That's great! Let's focus on one of them. You mentioned that you developed a React application for an online signing system during your internship at SKEWESS TECH. Can you tell me more about the challenges you faced in that project? For example, was there a specific technical problem you had to overcome, or was there a particular feature that posed a challenge?"},{"role":"user","content":" Yes sir, I will many challenges in this. First, I will collecting the data. In more than 1000 regime, I collected data. And I trained the model. So I faced many issues."},{"role":"assistant","content":"So, you faced challenges in collecting data for your project, specifically in dealing with a large dataset of over 1000 regimes. And on top of that, you had to train the model, which can be a complex task. That sounds like a tough challenge.\n\nCan you tell me more about the specific issues you faced during the data collection and model training processes? For example, were there any data quality issues, or was there any particular technique you used to overcome these challenges?"},{"role":"user","content":" Yes sir, pre-processing I will more effort, more time and spend because the data is structured format so easy to train the model. So I will more amount of data in pre-processing."},{"role":"assistant","content":"So, you had to spend a significant amount of time and effort on data preprocessing because the data was in a structured format, making it easier to train the model. That's a great point!\n\nCan you elaborate on what kind of preprocessing techniques you used to get the data in a suitable format for the model? For example, did you use any specific libraries or tools, such as pandas or scikit-learn, or did you implement custom solutions?"},{"role":"user","content":" Yes sir, I am using the normalization technique. I use the word to work model and this is very normalization. That's the data and vector DB and using."},{"role":"assistant","content":"So, you used normalization as a preprocessing technique to scale the data to a common range, making it easier for the model to learn from. That's a great approach!\n\nUsing word embeddings, such as Word2Vec or GloVe, is also a common technique to convert text data into vectors that can be used by machine learning models. Did you use any specific library or implementation for this, such as Gensim or spaCy, or did you implement a custom solution?"},{"role":"user","content":" Yes sir I normally use stemming model and also I arrange data"},{"role":"assistant","content":"So, you used stemming as a preprocessing technique to reduce words to their root form, which can help to reduce the dimensionality of the data and make it more efficient for the model to process.\n\nAnd you also mentioned that you arranged the data in a specific way. Can you elaborate on what kind of data arrangement you did? For example, did you create any specific data structures or formats, or did you use any specific libraries or tools to arrange the data?"}]

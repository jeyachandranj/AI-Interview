[{"role":"user","content":"hi sir"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Hello JeyachandranJ! Nice to meet you. I am Jeyachandran, the hiring officer. Thank you for coming in today. Can you start by telling me a bit about your experience working with Artificial Intelligence, specifically in the context of your internship at Shine Logics as an AI Project Developer?"},{"role":"user","content":"\n yes sir i am working the agency for sign logic sign logic and i developed a project like the speech to test building system"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Impressive! It sounds like you worked on a fascinating project. Can you tell me more about the \"speech-to-text building system\" you developed? What was the goal of the project, and what specific technologies or skills did you utilize to implement it?"},{"role":"user","content":" Yes sir, I developed a speech to test model using the Visper model. It is a very high accuracy model. I used the Visper and voice speech to convert to test and then make the building application."},{"role":"assistant","content":"That's great to hear! Visper is a well-known model for speech recognition. Can you walk me through the implementation process of integrating the Visper model with the building application? How did you handle things like audio processing, noise reduction, and intent detection in your project?"},{"role":"user","content":" Yes sir, I created a peaceful model with many issues I face, like the pre-processing because I can't tell the nice why. So I build a package, reduce the nice data and integrate the building system."},{"role":"assistant","content":"It sounds like you overcame some challenges during the development process. Pre-processing is indeed a crucial step in speech recognition, as it helps to improve the accuracy of the model. By creating a package to reduce noise and improve the quality of the audio data, you were able to integrate the Visper model with the building application successfully.\n\nCan you tell me more about the building application that you integrated the speech-to-text model with? What kind of features or functionality did you enable through this integration?"}]

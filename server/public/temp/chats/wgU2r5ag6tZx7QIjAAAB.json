Before we begin, I would like to remind you that this is a technical round, and we'll be discussing your project experiences and skills. Can you start by telling me about your experience with React in your current internship at SKEWESS TECH? What was your project about, and what technologies did you use?"},{"role":"user","content":"\n yes sir I create a project for even management system is a push-track monster project and used the front end react and back and express and a database I used the MongoDB it is a for login user communication one is the club member and the club head and a student and the admin login and I use a security for jwd token and i i indicated a racer bay"},{"role":"assistant","content":"It sounds like you worked on a significant project for event management. Can you clarify how you handled the authentication and authorization for different user roles, such as club members, club heads, students, and admins? How did you ensure that each user had the correct permissions and access to the resources?"},{"role":"user","content":" Yes sir, this is a club member create an event in Google form and the member sent to the club head and once head verify and submit to go to the admin and verify the event registration and submit and show to DB"},{"role":"assistant","content":"So, you used Google Forms to collect event creation requests from club members and then had a workflow where the club head would verify and submit the request to the admin, who would then verify and register the event in the database. That's a good use case for showcasing your project's functionality.\n\nCan you tell me more about how you implemented the frontend and backend of the application using React, Express, and MongoDB? Did you use any state management libraries like Redux or MobX?"},{"role":"user","content":" Yes sir, I integrated many libraries in Mongo's and encrypt because the password is stored to MongoDB, encrypt and store the password.

The student ID matching the attendance. So I will integrate it for the image detection. I scan the student ID card and apply OCR and face matching and I put attendance."},{"role":"assistant","content":"So you integrated AI-powered image detection to read student ID cards using OCR (Optical Character Recognition) and face matching to track attendance. That's a fascinating application of AI and computer vision.\n\nCan you tell me more about how you implemented the OCR and face matching? What specific libraries or tools did you use for this task?"}]
